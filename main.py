  # Naming variables

  """
  - Variable names can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores (_).
  They can start with a letter or an underscore (_), not with a number.

  - Variable names cannot contains space.
  To separate words in variable, you use underscore for example sorted_list

  - Variable names cannot be the same as keywords, reserved words, and built-in functions in Python.

  - Variable names should be concise and descriptive.
  For example, the active_user variable is more descriptive than the au.

  - Use underscore (_) to separate multiple words in the variable names.

  - Avoid using the letter l and the upper case letter O because they look like the number 1 and 0.
